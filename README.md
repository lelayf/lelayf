- 👋 Hi, I’m @lelayf
- 👀 I am interested in data systems at large, whether deterministic or predictive, with a particular concern for the ways data mutations can affect system behaviors and ultimately cascade as user-facing, catastrophic effects.
- 🌱 I am currently learning a bit of Rust and going through the Apollo certifications for their GraphQL server.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate with organizations seeking to add Kensu data observability capabilities to their systems
- 📫 How to reach me : francois.lelay@kensu.io
